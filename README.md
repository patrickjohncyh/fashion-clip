UPDATE (10/03/23): We have updated the model! We found that [laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K) checkpoint (thanks [Bin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bin-duan-56205310/)!) worked better than original OpenAI CLIP on Fashion. We thus fine-tune a newer (and better!) version of FashionCLIP (henceforth FashionCLIP 2.0), while keeping the architecture the same. We postulate that the performance gains afforded by `laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K` are due to the increased training data (5x OpenAI CLIP data). Our [thesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9), however, remains the same -- fine-tuning `laion/CLIP` on our fashion dataset improved zero-shot perofrmance across our benchmarks. See the below table comparing weighted macro F1 score across models.

## Information 

We are awaiting the official release of the Farfetch dataset, upon which fine-tuned model weights,
pre-processed image and text vectors will be made public. In the meanwhile, we currently use the 
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) implementation of `CLIP` and can use the model weights
from [OpenAI](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32) by following the standard hugginface 
naming convention (i.e. `fclip = FashionCLIP('<username>/<repo_name>', ... )`). We also support private
repositories (i.e. `fclip = FashionCLIP('<username>/<repo_name>', auth_token=<AUTH_TOKEN>, ... )`). 

See below for further details!

## Overview

`FashionCLIP` is a CLIP-like model fine-tuned for the fashion industry. We fine tune 
`CLIP` ([Radford et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9) on over 700K 
<image, text> pairs from the Farfetch dataset[^1].

We evaluate FashionCLIP by applying it to open problems in industry such as retrieval, classification
and fashion parsing. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning helps capture domain-specific concepts 
and generalizes them in zero-shot scenarios. We also supplement quantitative tests with qualitative analyses, 
and offer preliminary insights into how concepts grounded in a visual space unlocks linguistic generalization. 
Please see our [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9) for more details.

In this repository, you will find an API for interacting with `FashionCLIP` and an interactive demo built using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (coming soon!) 
 which showcases the capabilities of `FashionCLIP`.

## API & Demo


### Quick How To

Need a quick way to generate embeddings? do you want to test retrieval performance? 

First of all, you should be able to quickly install this using pip.

```
$ pip install fashion-clip 
```

If you have lists of texts and image paths, it is very easy to generate embeddings:

```python

from fashion_clip.fashion_clip import FashionCLIP

fclip = FashionCLIP('fashion-clip')

# we create image embeddings and text embeddings
image_embeddings = fclip.encode_images(images, batch_size=32)
text_embeddings = fclip.encode_text(texts, batch_size=32)

# we normalize the embeddings to unit norm (so that we can use dot product instead of cosine similarity to do comparisons)
image_embeddings = image_embeddings/np.linalg.norm(image_embeddings, ord=2, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
text_embeddings = text_embeddings/np.linalg.norm(text_embeddings, ord=2, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
```

**Use our [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z1hAxBnWjF76bEi9KQ6CMBBEmI_FVDrW?usp=sharing)** notebook to see more functionalities.


### HF API

```python

from PIL import Image
import requests
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel

model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip")

image = Image.open("images/image1.jpg")

inputs = processor(text=["a photo of a red shoe", "a photo of a black shoe"],
                   images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

outputs = model(**inputs)
logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # this is the image-text similarity score
probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)  
print(probs)
image.resize((224, 224))
```

### Additional Internal FashionCLIP API

#### Installation
From project root, install the `fashion-clip` package locally with 
```
$ pip install -e . 
```


There are two main abstractions to facilitate easy use of `FashionCLIP`.

First, the __`FCLIPDataset`__ class which encapsulates information related to a given catalog
and exposes information critical for `FashionCLIP`. Additionally, it provides helper functions
for quick exploration and visualization of data. The main initialization parameters are

```
name: str -> Name of dataset
image_source_path: str -> absolute path to images (can be local or s3) 
image_source_type: str -> type of source (i.e. local or s3)
catalog: List[dict] = None -> list of dicts containing at miniumum the keys ['id', 'image', 'caption']
```

For ease of use, the API also provides access to the dataset (_once it is officially released_), used in the paper 
for training `FahionCLIP`, by simply specifying the corresponding catalog name.

#### Pre-Included Dataset
```
from fashion_clip import FCLIPDataset
dataset = FCLIPDataset(name='FF', 
                       image_source_path='path/to/images', 
                       image_source_type='local')
```

#### Custom dataset

```
from fashion_clip import FCLIPDataset
my_catalog = [{'id': 1, 'image': 'x.jpg', 'caption': 'image x'}]
dataset = FCLIPDataset(name='my_dataset', 
                       image_source_path='path/to/images', 
                       image_source_type='local',
                       catalog=my_catalog)
```

The second abstraction is the __`FashionCLIP`__ class, which takes in a Hugging Face CLIP model name and 
an `FCLIPDataset`, and provides convenient functions to perform tasks such as multi-modal retrieval, 
zero-shot classification and localization. The initialization parameters for `FashionCLIP` are as follows:

```
model_name: str -> Name of model OR path to local model
dataset: FCLIPDataset -> Dataset, 
normalize: bool -> option to convert embeddings to unit norm  
approx: bool -> option to use approximate nearest neighbors
```

Similar to the `FCLIPDataset` abstraction, we have included a pre-trained `FashionCLIP` model from the paper, hosted
[here](https://huggingface.co/patrickjohncyh/fashion-clip). If an unknown dataset and model combination is received, 
the image and caption vectors will be generated upon object instantiation, otherwise pre-computed vectors/embeddings will 
be pulled from S3.

```
from fashion_clip import FCLIPDataset, FashionCLIP
dataset = FCLIPDataset(name='FF', 
                       image_source_path='path/to/images', 
                       image_source_type='local')
fclip = FashionCLIP('fasihon-clip', ff_dataset)
```
